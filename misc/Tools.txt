Mongodb:

Step 1 — Adding the MongoDB Repository
MongoDB is already included in Ubuntu package repositories, but the official MongoDB repository provides most up-to-date version and is the recommended way of installing the software. In this step, we will add this official repository to our server.

Ubuntu ensures the authenticity of software packages by verifying that they are signed with GPG keys, so we first have to import they key for the official MongoDB repository.

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
After successfully importing the key, you will see:

Output
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
Next, we have to add the MongoDB repository details so apt will know where to download the packages from.

Issue the following command to create a list file for MongoDB.

echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.2.list
After adding the repository details, we need to update the packages list.

sudo apt-get update
Step 2 — Installing and Verifying MongoDB
Now we can install the MongoDB package itself.

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
This command will install several packages containing latest stable version of MongoDB along with helpful management tools for the MongoDB server.

Next, start MongoDB with systemctl.

sudo systemctl start mongod
You can also use systemctl to check that the service has started properly.

sudo systemctl status mongod

sudo systemctl enable mongod
